      <p class="h3 text-center">How We Help Our Community</p>
            <p class="card-text"> We bridge gaps in services for working families and retirees. Saint Saviour's Center is a community outreach organization that addresses largely unmet needs for low-income residents of Wake County.   

              We serve families and seniors who have an income, yet struggle to make ends meet. Each year, the Center assists more than 10,000 people who lack resources to overcome hardships associated with poverty, aging, hunger and homelessness.

              We also provide housing for affiliated nonprofits in the area. You can read more about them below.

              Annually, we host 4 separate fundraising events to ensure that we are able to continue our work in the community. We host a 10K in the Spring, Christmas Gala and Dinner/Live Auction each Fall. These events are not only necessary to continue our work, they are a lot of fun for both our volunteers and attendees.

      <p class="h3 text-center">Wake County Diaper Bank</p>
            <p class="card-text"> The provision of disposable diapers and wipes for the first year of a baby's life costs a staggering $1,104.00. Since 2010, Saint Savour's Center has worked diligently to offset these costs for struggling Wake County parents. Our effots are successful due to the generosity of many community groups, churches, schools and businesses in the area. The Diaper Train then distributes the diapers in two ways:

        <div class="col-md-12">
            Volunteers deliver diapers to local, non-profit organizations that serve families in crisis or transition. 
            Families with a referral from an approved referring agency may come to Saint Saviour's Center on Tuesday or Thursday between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon to receive diapers.  Referrals are required, and families must reside in Wake County, NC.
            Due to the program's success, it has a dedicated website. Please visit www.diapertrain.org for more information. </p>

<div class="col-md-12">
      <p class="h3 text-center">Super Seniors</p>
            <p class="card-text"> Older adults need to stay physically, mentally and spiritually active in order to remain independent and maintain a high quality of life.  Healthy Living for Seniors is a whole-person program for seniors in public housing who do not have access to resources they need. This program currently serves residents of Glenwood Towers and Carriage House communities in Raleigh.

            Our team of staff and volunteers offer classes on aging, with topics such as chronic illness, depression, loneliness, nutrition and exercise.  Clergy and lay leaders from local churches assist with programs that address spiritual needs.  Volunteer-led activities include arts and crafts, bingo, knitting and crochet, book club, walking groups, social events and outings. 
            The Glenwood South Book Club meets on the first and third Mondays of each month at Glenwood Towers.</p>
